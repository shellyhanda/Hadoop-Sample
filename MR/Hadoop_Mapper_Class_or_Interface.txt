I am a bit confused about the basic Mapper structure in Hadoop. On the web, many example implementations use Mapper as a class and thus their classes extend Mapper. As far as I have seen, which is Hadoop 19, Mapper is an interface. What happened?

In the old API, Mappers implemented an interface as you might expect.
When the big overhaul came around, they decided to change it to a fully fledged class so that it can act as the often needed Identity Mapper if used as is, or extended for your own implementations.
It's just a matter of whether you're using the old or new API for your project, you shouldn't mix - org.apache.hadoop.mapred is the old API, org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce is the new.
