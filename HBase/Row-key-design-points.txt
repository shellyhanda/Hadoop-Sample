Row key determines how records for a given table are scattered throughout various
regions of the HBase cluster. In HBase, all the row keys are sorted and each region stores
a range of these sorted row keys. Each region is pinned to a region server (i.e. a node in
the cluster).
A well-known anti-pattern is to use timestamp for row keys because it would make most
of the put and get requests to be focussed on a single region and hence a single region
server which somewhat defeats the purpose of having a distributed system. Itâ€™s best to
choose row keys so the load on the cluster is fairly distributed.
